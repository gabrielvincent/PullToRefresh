PullToRefresh is a template which provides a TableView with the pull-to-refresh system. Simply drag down the TableView until you see the text "Pull down to refresh" change to "Release to refresh". If the user releases when the arrow is pointing up, then the method -(void)updateMethod will be called. Here's where you should implement whatever actions you want. It's suggested that you use NSOperation so the actions you perform won't interfere in the animation smoothness.
